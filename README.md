# ms-comp-challenge-3



This project is the final static composition challenge for Module 1 at Turing. The goal of the project is to recreate the provided layout with the option to change copy, colors, and images; additionally, the site is required to be responsive and all layouts for different screen sizes were designed by me. I chose to do my site on the Carpathian Mountain range in Romania. I'm trying to learn Romanian right now so I challenged myself to do the comp in Romanian (it is far from perfect but it was a fun experiment)! There are hover states on every button, all items in the navigation bar on the right, and the page tabs in the header. The site is responsive from very large desktop screens to mobile devices.
